File Validators gem adds file size and content type validations to ActiveModel.
Any module that uses ActiveModel, for example ActiveRecord, can use these file validators.

## Support

* ActiveModel versions: 3.2, 4 and 5.
* Rails versions: 3.2, 4 and 5.

As of version `2.2`, activemodel 3.0 and 3.1 will no longer be supported.
For activemodel 3.0 and 3.1, please use file_validators version `<= 2.1`.

It has been tested to work with Carrierwave, Paperclip, Dragonfly, Refile etc file uploading solutions.
Validations works both before and after uploads.

## Installation

Add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'file_validators'
```

## Examples

ActiveModel example:

```ruby
class Profile
  include ActiveModel::Validations

  attr_accessor :avatar
  validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than_or_equal_to: 100.kilobytes },
                     file_content_type: { allow: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'] } 
end
```
ActiveRecord example:

```ruby
class Profile < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than_or_equal_to: 100.kilobytes },
                     file_content_type: { allow: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png'] }
end
```

You can also use `:validates_file_size` and `:validates_file_content_type` idioms.

## API

### File Size Validator:

* `in`: A range of bytes or a proc that returns a range
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { in: 100.kilobytes..1.megabyte }
```
* `less_than`: Less than a number in bytes or a proc that returns a number
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than: 2.gigabytes }
```
* `less_than_or_equal_to`: Less than or equal to a number in bytes or a proc that returns a number
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than_or_equal_to: 50.bytes } 
```
* `greater_than`: greater than a number in bytes or a proc that returns a number
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { greater_than: 1.byte } 
```
* `greater_than_or_equal_to`: Greater than or equal to a number in bytes or a proc that returns a number
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 50.bytes } 
```
* `message`: Error message to display. With all the options above except `:in`, you will get `count` as a replacement. 
With `:in` you will get `min` and `max` as replacements. 
`count`, `min` and `max` each will have its value and unit together.
You can write error messages without using any replacement.
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than: 100.kilobytes,
                                message: 'avatar should be less than %{count}' } 
```
```ruby
validates :document, file_size: { in: 1.kilobyte..1.megabyte,
                                  message: 'must be within %{min} and %{max}' }
```
* `if`: A lambda or name of an instance method. Validation will only be run if this lambda or method returns true.
* `unless`: Same as `if` but validates if lambda or method returns false.

You can combine different options.
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than: 1.megabyte,
                                greater_than_or_equal_to: 20.kilobytes }
```
The following two examples are equivalent:
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { greater_than_or_equal_to: 500.kilobytes,
                                less_than_or_equal_to: 3.megabytes }
```
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { in: 500.kilobytes..3.megabytes }
```
Options can also take `Proc`/`lambda`:

```ruby
validates :avatar, file_size: { less_than: lambda { |record| record.size_in_bytes } }
```

### File Content Type Validator

* `allow`: Allowed content types.  Can be a single content type or an array.  Each type can be a String or a Regexp. It also accepts `proc`. Allows all by default.
```ruby
# string
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: 'image/jpeg' }
```
```ruby
# array of strings
validates :attachment, file_content_type: { allow: ['image/jpeg', 'text/plain'] }
```
```ruby
# regexp
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: /^image\/.*/ }
```
```ruby
# array of regexps
validates :attachment, file_content_type: { allow: [/^image\/.*/, /^text\/.*/] }
```
```ruby
# array of regexps and strings
validates :attachment, file_content_type: { allow: [/^image\/.*/, 'video/mp4'] }
```
```ruby
# proc/lambda example
validates :video, file_content_type: { allow: lambda { |record| record.content_types } }
```
* `exclude`: Forbidden content types. Can be a single content type or an array. Each type
can be a String or a Regexp. It also accepts `proc`. See `:allow` options examples.
* `mode`: `:strict` or `:relaxed`. `:strict` mode can detect content type based on the contents
of the files. It also detects media type spoofing (see more in [security](#security)).
`:relaxed` mode uses file name to detect the content type using `mime-types` gem.
If mode option is not set then the validator uses form supplied content type.
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: 'image/jpeg', mode: :strict }
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: 'image/jpeg', mode: :relaxed }
```
* `message`: The message to display when the uploaded file has an invalid content type.
You will get `types` as a replacement. You can write error messages without using any replacement.
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: ['image/jpeg', 'image/gif'],
                                        message: 'only %{types} are allowed' }
```
```ruby
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: ['image/jpeg', 'image/gif'],
                                        message: 'Avatar only allows jpeg and gif' }
```
* `if`: A lambda or name of an instance method. Validation will only be run is this lambda or method returns true.
* `unless`: Same as `if` but validates if lambda or method returns false.

You can combine `:allow` and `:exclude`:
```ruby
# this will allow all the image types except png and gif
validates :avatar, file_content_type: { allow: /^image\/.*/, exclude: ['image/png', 'image/gif'] }
```

## Security

This gem can use Unix file command to get the content type based on the content of the file rather
than the extension. This prevents fake content types inserted in the request header.

It also prevents file media type spoofing. For example, user may upload a .html document as 
a part of the EXIF header of a valid JPEG file. Content type validator will identify its content type
as `image/jpeg` and, without spoof detection, it may pass the validation and be saved as .html document
thus exposing your application to a security vulnerability. Media type spoof detector wont let that happen.
It will not allow a file having `image/jpeg` content type to be saved as `text/plain`. It checks only media
type mismatch, for example `text` of `text/plain` and `image` of `image/jpeg`. So it will not prevent
`image/jpeg` from saving as `image/png` as both have the same `image` media type.

**note**: This security feature is disabled by default. To enable it, first add `ruby-filemagic` gem in
your Gemfile and then add `mode: :strict` option in [content type validations](#file-content-type-validator).
`:strict` mode may not work in direct file uploading systems as the file is not passed along with the form.

## i18n Translations

File Size Errors
* `file_size_is_in`: takes `min` and `max` as replacements
* `file_size_is_less_than`: takes `count` as replacement
* `file_size_is_less_than_or_equal_to`: takes `count` as replacement
* `file_size_is_greater_than`: takes `count` as replacement
* `file_size_is_greater_than_or_equal_to`: takes `count` as replacement

Content Type Errors
* `allowed_file_content_types`: generated when you have specified allowed types but the content type
of the file doesn't match. takes `types` as replacement.
* `excluded_file_content_types`: generated when you have specified excluded types and the content type
of the file matches anyone of them. takes `types` as replacement.

This gem provides `en` translations for this errors under `errors.messages` namespace.
If you want to override and/or create other locales, you can
check [this](https://github.com/musaffa/file_validators/blob/master/lib/file_validators/locale/en.yml) out to see how translations are done.  

You can override all of them with the `:message` option.

For unit format, it will use `number.human.storage_units.format` from your locale.
For unit translation, `number.human.storage_units` is used.
Rails applications already have these translations either in ActiveSupport's locale (Rails 4) or in ActionView's locale (Rails 3).
In case your setup doesn't have the translations, here's an example for `en`:

```yml
en:
  number:
    human:
      storage_units:
        format: "%n %u"
        units:
          byte:
            one:   "Byte"
            other: "Bytes"
          kb: "KB"
          mb: "MB"
          gb: "GB"
          tb: "TB"
```

## Further Instructions

If you are using `:strict` or `:relaxed` mode, for content types which are not supported
by mime-types gem, you need to register those content types. For example, you can register
`.docx` in the initializer:
```Ruby
# config/initializers/mime_types.rb
Mime::Type.register "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", :docx
```

If you want to see what content type `:strict` mode returns, run this command in the shell:
```Shell
$ file -b --mime-type your-file.xxx
```

## Issues

**Carrierwave** - You are adding file validators to a model, then you are recommended to keep extension_white_list &/
extension_black_list in the uploaders (in case you don't have, add that method).
As of this writing (see [issue](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave/issues/361)), Carrierwave
uploaders start processing a file immediately after its assignment (even before the validators are called).

## Tests

```Shell
$ rake
$ rake test:unit
$ rake test:integration

# test different active model versions
$ bundle exec appraisal install
$ bundle exec appraisal rake
```
